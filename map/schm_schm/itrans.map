#	Symbols
#	-------
#	Anusvara:       .n/M/.m
#	Avagraha:       .a    (`S' like symbol basically to replace a after o)
#	Halant:         .h    (to get half-form of the consonant - saMvR^itOkAraM)
#	Visarga:        H     (looks like a colon character)
#	
#	
#	pRashLeShaM(avagraha) is not defined in mozhi.
# 	So not configured here.
#	ITRANS does not define E, O, t and zh
# 	The scheme here is extended ITRANS.
