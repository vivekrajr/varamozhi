<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Vinod(paathaari)</B><DD><P>for the name Varamozhi and for choosing
most appropriate sample Malayalam text.
<P>
<DT><B>Rajeev(ikru)</B><DD><P>for patiently using 'mal'  through
its bug-full primitive phases. He got a reasonable collection
of Malayalam cassette covers for his newly recoded cassettes
at the end of system testing. He only have developed the web
interface which covers a reasonable number of schemes and fonts.
<P>
<DT><B>Rajesh(thavala)</B><DD><P>for making a nice banner for Varamozhi
advertisement. He used the wonderful Malayalam font designed
by Anoop.
<P>
<DT><B>Anoop(bettachchan)</B><DD><P>was doing the remote site testing of
'lam' of Varamozhi.  This poor guy tried to install it on HP
and I received a big list of error output by next mail.
<P>
<DT><B>Anthony P. Stone (Tony)</B><DD><P>for the insights he gave in
Indic transliteration.
<P>
<DT><B>Soji(achchaayan)</B><DD><P>for making me aware of the need of a COPYING file
and pointed out how I could become Next Century Bill Gates
with Varamozhi alone.
