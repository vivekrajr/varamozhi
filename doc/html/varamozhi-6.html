<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Formalisation</A></H2>

<P>In the model the author uses, a sequence of one or more
characters to represent each Malayalam letter. In the following
sections, with the help of few definitions, we will see algorithms for
generating Malayalam script from the character stream representing
Malayalam text. Its implementation is mentioned in the last section.
<P>
<P>In this section, Malayalam text will appear within single
quotes(') written using Mozhi scheme described in chapter 
<A HREF="varamozhi-5.html#mozhi">Mozhi 7 bit transliteration scheme</A>.
Plus(+) is used as the string concatenation operator and
forward slash (/) indicates either the string before or the string
after the forward slash or both are under consideration.

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Deviations from Malayalam Scripting Conventions</A>
</H2>

<P>We assume following deviations from the traditional Malayalam
scripting conventions. This is for the ease of generalisation of
transliteration properties.
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Consonant letters are considered without the default <EM>`a'</EM> vowel
sound along with it.
</LI>
<LI> <EM>`anuswaaram'</EM>(anuswara) is considered to be the <EM>`chillu'</EM> (pure) form
of <EM>`ma'</EM>.
</LI>
<LI> <EM>`samvr^thOkaaram'</EM>(halant or virama) has got two functions in
Malayalam scripting.

<UL>
<LI> As a joiner to indicate the conjunct of two consonants.</LI>
<LI> As the half-<EM>`u'</EM> vowel. It is used only at the end of a word
(ex: <EM>`ath~'</EM>) and is applicable in new orthography only. In old
orthography this usage is found north Kerala. In south Kerala,
half-<EM>`u'</EM> is written as the combination of sign for <EM>`u'</EM> and the
halant sign. [

In this paper semantics of halant is first one only. For that, it is
considered as a vowel without any sound.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Letter:</B><DD><P>Letters are the basic phonetic building blocks of a language.
Along with the sound it has one or more graphical forms also.
<P>
<DT><B>Symbol:</B><DD><P>In contrast to a letter, a <EM>symbol</EM> does not have its own
phonetic identity (ex: coma, colon or visarga).
<P>
<DT><B>Literal:</B><DD><P>Literal is a sequence of letters which has a single
fused graphical form when written either independently or
combined with any other letters (ex: <EM>`n'</EM>, <EM>`nn'</EM> and
<EM>`yu'</EM>). Usually it includes all letters and all conjunct
forms consisting of two or more letters. Literals representing
the letters are called base literals and those representing
the conjunct forms are called derived literals. Size of a
literal is the number of characters being used to represent
that literal in the given transliteration scheme.  |x|  operator
denote the size of the literal x with respect to that
scheme. A literal can also be classified as vocal or
consonantal depending on whether it can be pronounced
independently or not.
<P>Concept of literals is closely linked to fonts or some code
for information interchange in general. Whether a character
sequence has a single fused graphical form or not, can be
decided only by analysing that code.
<P>
<DT><B>Glyph:</B><DD><P>graphical form of a literal or symbol.
<P>
<DT><B>Text:</B><DD><P>It refers to the sequence of characters representing
transliterated Malayalam. It can also be interpreted as a
sequence of literals and symbols represented by that character
stream.
<P>
<DT><B>Script:</B><DD><P>sequence of glyphs denoting a text.
<P>
<DT><B>Transliteration:</B><DD><P>the representation of the glyphs of a source script
by the glyphs of a target script. In our description, source
script is Malayalam and target script is English.
<P>
<DT><B>Reverse transliteration:</B><DD><P>the process whereby the glyphs of a target
script are transliterated into those of the source script.
<P>
<DT><B>Conjunct:</B><DD><P>a sequence of literals such that all the literals other than
the last are consonantal literals. Last literal can be either
vocal or consonantal. (eg: In the conjunct <EM>`sva'</EM>, <EM>`s'</EM> is the
first literal, <EM>`v'</EM> is the second and <EM>`a'</EM> is the third. More
over, <EM>`svar'</EM> is not a conjunct because the vocal literal <EM>`a'</EM>
does not come as the last literal.)
<P>
<DT><B>Context:</B><DD><P>Context of a literal refers to its neighbourhood in a text.
There are two different contexts for a literal. One is the
lexical context and other is the phonetical context. By
default context means phonetical context. A literal can have
null neighbourhood also. That is, when no other sound is
pronounced along with it.
</DL>
<P>A detailed list of related definitions can be found in [
<A HREF="#stone">Antony P. Stone's transliteration page</A>].
<P>
<H3>Different Glyphs of a Literal</H3>

<P>A literal assumes different glyphs depending on its
context. They are classified as following:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Independent glyph</B><DD><P>A vocal literal assumes independent glyph in null context. (eg:
graphical form to represent a single <EM>`o'</EM> sound). Any consonant
literal X assumes independent glyph in the conjunct X + <EM>`a'</EM>. (eg:
graphical form of <EM>`ka'</EM>)
<P>
<DT><B>Sign glyph or Partial glyph</B><DD><P>Graphical form of the literal when it appears last in a two literal
conjunct. (eg: graphical form of <EM>`o'</EM> in <EM>`ko'</EM>; form of <EM>`ya'</EM> in <EM>`kya'</EM>
and form of <EM>`na'</EM> in <EM>`sna'</EM>). It can have two parts which come on
left and right of the independent glyph of the first literal.  They
are called "left sign glyph" and "right sign glyph"
respectively. (eg: in <EM>`ko'</EM>, <EM>`o'</EM> has both sign glyphs. In <EM>`kya'</EM>, <EM>`y'</EM>
has only right sign glyph and in <EM>`kra'</EM>, <EM>`r'</EM> has only left sign
glyph). More over, all the vocal literals except <EM>`a'</EM> have sign
glyphs.
<P>
<P>The literal <EM>`v'</EM> has two right sign glyphs. The sign glyph which
appears when first literal is not <EM>`y'</EM> or <EM>`zh'</EM> is called primary
right sign glyph of <EM>`v'</EM>. The one which appears with <EM>`y'</EM> and <EM>`zh'</EM> is
called secondary right sign glyph of <EM>`v'</EM>.  For example, see the
words <EM>`svapnam'</EM>, <EM>`vaazhv~'</EM> and <EM>`meyvazhakkam'</EM>.
<P>
<DT><B>Chillu glyph</B><DD><P>Only <EM>`N'</EM>, <EM>`n'</EM>, <EM>`m'</EM>, <EM>`r'</EM>, <EM>`l'</EM>, <EM>`L'</EM> and <EM>`rr'</EM> have single fused glyph
in null context. Those glyphs are called chillu glyphs. (In old
orthography <EM>`k'</EM> and <EM>`y'</EM> also had chillu glyphs. Described in 
<A HREF="#gundert">Gundert's Dictionary</A>.)
<P>
<P>The chillu glyphs of <EM>`r'</EM> and <EM>`rr'</EM> are same. There are two different
chillu glyphs for <EM>`r/rr'</EM>. The graphical form <EM>`r'</EM> assumes when it is
the last literal of a word, is called primary chillu glyph of
<EM>`r/rr'</EM> (eg: graphical form of <EM>`r'</EM> in <EM>`avar'</EM>). The chillu glyph of
<EM>`r'</EM> as a dot over the next consonant in the word is called
secondary chillu glyph of <EM>`r/rr'</EM> (eg: graphical form of <EM>`r'</EM> in the
word <EM>`charkka'</EM> written in old orthography). In new orthography,
primary chillu glyph itself is used in place of secondary.

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Rules for Reverse Transliteration</A>
</H2>

<P>Reverse transliteration has two steps. First, parsing the
character stream of transliterated Malayalam text into sequence of
literals. Then generating the glyph sequence corresponding to sequence
of literals by looking at the context of each literal.
<P>
<H3>Parsing Stream of Characters into Literals</H3>

<P>In the model we use, sequence of one or more characters
represent each Malayalam letter. Hence there arises the problem of
splitting the character stream representing Malayalam text into
corresponding literals. For example, if the stream is <EM>`thn'</EM>, we can
view it as <EM>`t'</EM> + <EM>`hn'</EM> or <EM>`th'</EM> + <EM>`n'</EM> or <EM>`t'</EM>+<EM>`h'</EM>+<EM>`n'</EM> or <EM>`thn'</EM>. We have
to choose correct one from these different options. The generalised
rule is as follows:
<P>
<P>Let the character stream S be  a<SUB>1</SUB> + a<SUB>2</SUB> + ... + a<SUB>n</SUB> where a<SUB>i</SUB> (1 &lt;= i &lt;= n) is a character.We can consider
the non-trivial case where S can be split in two ways as S<SUB>1</SUB> = x<SUB>1</SUB> + x<SUB>2</SUB>
+ ... + x<SUB>p</SUB> and S<SUB>2</SUB> = y<SUB>1</SUB> + y<SUB>2</SUB> +...+
y<SUB>q</SUB> such that x<SUB>1</SUB> != y<SUB>1</SUB> and x<SUB>p</SUB> != y<SUB>q</SUB>
where x<SUB>i</SUB>(1&lt;=i&lt;=p) and y<SUB>i</SUB>(1&lt;=i&lt;=q) are character sequences
representing single literals. Without loss of generality S<SUB>1</SUB> will be
chosen if either of the following conditions are true:
<P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> p = 1 and q &gt; 1</LI>
<LI> p &gt; 1 and q &gt; 1 and x<SUB>p</SUB> and
y<SUB>q</SUB> are base literals and  | x<SUB>p</SUB> | &gt; | y<SUB>q</SUB> | </LI>
</OL>
<P>
<H3>Reverse Transliteration Function</H3>

<P>Next step is to generate the glyph sequence from the sequence
of literals obtained. A rule based algorithm is described below.
<P>
<P>Let X, X<SUB>1</SUB> and X<SUB>2</SUB> denote conjuncts; z and z<SUB>1</SUB> denote
literals. G(X) be a function mapping from the given conjunct X to its
script. G(X) is defined below. There will be a number of clauses such
that each one has a condition and an expression returning a value. In
a call to G(X), only the clause which satisfies its gate condition
will be selected and will return the value of the corresponding
expression. If two clauses satisfy the condition, the first one will
be selected lexically.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>  X is null.

G(X) = null
</LI>
<LI> X = X<SUB>1</SUB> + X<SUB>2</SUB> where X<SUB>1</SUB> and X<SUB>2</SUB> are non-null conjuncts and first
literal of X<SUB>2</SUB> has no sign glyph.

G(X) = G(X<SUB>1</SUB>) + G(X<SUB>2</SUB>)
</LI>
<LI> X = X<SUB>1</SUB> + z + X<SUB>2</SUB> where X<SUB>2</SUB> is not a single vocal literal (X<SUB>1</SUB> and
X<SUB>2</SUB> can be null) and z has chillu glyph.

G(X) = G(X<SUB>1</SUB>) + <CODE>&lt;(primary)chillu glyph of z&gt;</CODE> + G(X<SUB>2</SUB>)
</LI>
<LI> Last literal of X is not a vocal literal.

G(X) = G(X + <EM>`~'</EM>)
</LI>
<LI> X = z + <EM>`a'</EM> where z is a literal or X is a single vocal literal.

G(X) = <CODE>&lt;independent glyph of z&gt;</CODE>
</LI>
<LI> X = X<SUB>1</SUB> + z where z is a vocal literal or X = X<SUB>1</SUB> + z + a.
In any of the above cases, X<SUB>1</SUB> is non-null.

G(X) = <CODE>&lt;left sign glyph of z&gt;</CODE>
+ G(X1 + <EM>`a'</EM>)
+ <CODE>&lt;(primary)right sign glyph of z&gt;</CODE>
</LI>
<LI> Special cases (deviations from above clauses)

<UL>
<LI> If there is a sub-conjunct z+z<SUB>1</SUB> in X such that z=z<SUB>1</SUB>, then
chillu glyph is not used for z.
</LI>
<LI> If there is a sub-conjunct z+z<SUB>1</SUB> in X such that z=z<SUB>1</SUB>, then sign
glyph is not used for z<SUB>1</SUB> when z is not in {<EM>`g'</EM>, <EM>`D'</EM>, <EM>`S'</EM>, <EM>`s'</EM>}.
</LI>
<LI> Let z be in {<EM>`N'</EM>, <EM>`n'</EM>, <EM>`l'</EM>}. For any sub-conjunct z + <EM>`v'</EM> in X,
z is considered as a literal having no chillu glyph.
</LI>
<LI> Let z<SUB>1</SUB> be in {<EM>`y'</EM>, <EM>`r'</EM>, <EM>`rr'</EM>}. For any sub-conjunct z + z<SUB>1</SUB> in
X, z is considered as a literal having no chillu glyph.
</LI>
<LI> Let z<SUB>1</SUB> be in {<EM>`T'</EM>, <EM>`Th'</EM>, <EM>`D'</EM>, <EM>`Dh'</EM>}. For any sub-conjunct <EM>`N'</EM> +
z<SUB>1</SUB> in X, <EM>`N'</EM> is considered as a literal having no chillu glyph.
</LI>
<LI> Let z<SUB>1</SUB> be in {<EM>`t'</EM>, <EM>`th'</EM>, <EM>`d'</EM>, <EM>`dh'</EM>}. For any sub-conjunct <EM>`n'</EM> +
z1 in X, <EM>`n'</EM> is considered as a literal having no chillu glyph.
</LI>
<LI> Let z be in {<EM>`th'</EM>, <EM>`g'</EM>, <EM>`h'</EM>} and z1 be in {<EM>`n'</EM>, <EM>`m'</EM>}. For any
sub-conjunct z + z<SUB>1</SUB> in X, z<SUB>1</SUB> is considered as a literal having
no sign glyph.
</LI>
<LI> Secondary chillu glyph of <EM>`r/rr'</EM> is used instead of primary, if
<EM>`r'</EM> is not the last literal of X.
           </LI>
<LI> Secondary sign glyph of <EM>`v'</EM> is used instead of primary, if
literal before <EM>`v'</EM> in X is <EM>`zh'</EM> or <EM>`y'</EM>.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<H3>Classes of Literals</H3>

<P>From the above algorithm, we may see that many literals have
exactly same joining property with other literals. So we classify
literals into different classes such that any two literals in a class
has same joining property with:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> any literal in any other classes</LI>
<LI> other literals in the same class</LI>
<LI> same literal itself</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<P>The classes are as follows:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> <EM>`a'</EM></LI>
<LI> Base vocal literals other than <EM>`a'</EM></LI>
<LI> Derived vocal literals</LI>
<LI> Base consonantal literals (other than those described below)</LI>
<LI> Derived consonantal literals</LI>

<LI> <EM>`l'</EM></LI>
<LI> <EM>`v'</EM></LI>
<LI> <EM>`L'</EM></LI>
</OL>
<P>
<P>     We know that the set of literals depends on the code for
information exchange. The concept of classes of literals gives
flexibility for number of literals to defer between schemes. This
makes it easy for generalised implementation of the rules since the
classes alone are fixed.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Parser Directives</A>
</H2>

<P>   Following symbols and literals are required in the model being
considered for transliteration. These additional entries can also be
viewed as parser directives.
<P>
<H3>Zero Width Symbol (ZWS)</H3>

<P>      Semantically ZWS acts as a symbol having zero width. This
symbol is useful for writing many Arabic words where independent glyph
of a vocal literal comes in the middle of a word. (eg:<EM>`va_aL~'</EM>. If it
were written as <EM>`vaaL~'</EM> then it would mean <EM>"sword"</EM>). Similarly another
context is where we want to avoid the usage of the conjunct glyphs or
sign glyphs when by default they are the reverse transliteration
output. Few conflicting example pairs, if this symbol is avoided
are: [

<LI> <EM>`va_aL~'</EM>,    <EM>`vaaL~'</EM></LI>
<LI> <EM>`sam_rambham'</EM>, <EM>`saamraajyam'</EM></LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Zero Width Literal (ZWL)</H3>

<P>This symbol is used to get the vowel signs alone. The
semantics of ZWL is same as that of ZWS except that ZWL has the
properties of a literal where as ZWS has the properties of a symbol.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 Existing Implementation</A>
</H2>

<P>The implementation of the algorithm by the author is available
from the 
<A HREF="http://members.tripod.com/~CibuCJ/varamozhi.html">Varamozhi site</A>. It is
distributed under [
<A HREF="#gnu">GNU Public License</A>]. Input for
the generator consist of the scheme describing the character sequence
adopted for each literal, the class to which the literal belongs and
different glyphs of that literal. Output is the C code for generating
the glyph sequence from the character stream representing Malayalam
text according to the rules of reverse transliteration described in
the previous section. The rules are implemented for each class of
literals.
<P>
<P>Salient features of the implementation are:

attempted on the parser generated from Varamozhi.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6 Conclusion</A>
</H2>

<P>Author believes, theory of reverse and forward transliterator
generators can be developed for all languages having phonetic
scripts. More over, everything could be put under single generic
framework. The work being presented through this paper is a very
specific instance of this, much larger framework and a starting point
for further research in this area.
