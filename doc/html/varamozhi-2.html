<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 What is transliteration ?</A>
</H2>

<P>It is about changing the script in which a text is written.
For us the text is in Malayalam. We need to change it from
English script to Malayalam script such that it is read exactly
same as in English. Here we are in trouble because English
has much less number of phonetic entities and its corelation
between script and phonetics is too loose. So we impose some
rules like <EM>`aa'</EM> or <EM>`zh'</EM> corresponding to such and such Malayalam
letters. The collection of such rules is refered as a transliteration
scheme. The transliteration scheme used in this document is described
in the chapter 
<A HREF="varamozhi-5.html#mozhi">Mozhi</A>. Consider following sample
Malayalam text written in English using Mozhi scheme:

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Why a transliterator generator ?</A>
</H2>

<P>There are a lot of transliteration tools available
today. Most of them are designed only for one particular font and one
transliteration scheme. But, for an Indian regional language, there
exists a number of transliteration standards and enumerable fonts
which do not follow any standard among themselves. Hence the relevance
of a transliterator generator.
